# esp32HAWindSensor

A quick prototype for an enviromental sensor that has windrpm, winddirection, inside/ outside temp, atm. pressure and lights sensors. Mainly just a way
to test out the Wroom ESP32/ C++ implementation of ESP websocket client that can send data to Homeassistant.

> [!NOTE]
An endpoint needs to be created inside HA, so in my case this is done in a custom integration that will accept the JSON object and update the HA entities.

TODO: some more explanation will be added here at some point.
